#Description

After Brexit, I became acutely aware of the turbulent GBP price. Exchanging pounds to dollars became a competitive task in which I aimed to achieve the best rates possible. Instead of downloading an app to monitor rates, I created this app which taught me `desktop applications`, `Electron`, `Javascript`, `HTML`, `CSS` and usage of an API. The API is from https://www.alphavantage.co/ and is free to use. The URL I use is _extremely_ popular so I wouldn't recommend fetching data any more often than 1 minute. The interval constant is EXCHANGE_INTERVAL and is measured in milliseconds.
